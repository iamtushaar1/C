# C++ / GUITAR FREQUENCY
For this C++ program, we were provided with the frequency of each string (6) from A to E. The user can enter the number of frets based on the guitar. The program wanted us to take out the frequency by a certain formula which would come out if the user pressed certain frets and pulled certain strings.
